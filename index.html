            <h3>Title: Process Engineer (front end)</h3>
            <p><strong>Reports to:</strong> Process Development Manager</p>
            <p><strong>Employment type:</strong> Permanent</p>
            <p><strong>Location:</strong> Cambridge (UK)</p>
            <h3>About us</h3>
            <p>FlexEnable’s award-winning flexible technology platform, together with its unique FlexiOM™ materials, brings transformational possibilities to products including AR and VR optics, ePrivacy screens, automotive smart windows and displays. The organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) backplane process developed by FlexEnable, allows transistors to be manufactured at less than 100°C – by far the lowest temperature process for transistor manufacturing in the world. This allows, for the first time, commonly available and optically ideal flexible bio-degradable substrates such as TAC film to be used instead of glass. FlexEnable’s game-changing technology is used to make active-matrix flexible displays and flexible active liquid crystal (LC) optical films which are thin, light and conformable to almost any surface. OTFT display technology is already on the market today incorporated into a consumer product – a crypto wallet device with an E Ink display uniquely wrapped around a 180-degree bend.</p>
            <p>Today, FlexEnable has around 550 patents and patent applications globally for OTFT and LC cell materials, processes and device architectures. With an established supply chain for OTFT production, FlexEnable has technology transfer programmes and mass production underway with several leading display manufacturers in Asia as well as commercial programmes with some of the world’s biggest brands in consumer electronics.</p>
